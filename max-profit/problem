Given a chart of stock prices over 40 days, with daily min, max, and
starting price, write an algorithm to find the max profit that could
have been made over a given day range. Buy and sell must take place at
the start of the day.

In other words, given
[
	{ start: 5, min: 1, max: 8 }, // day 0 
	{ start: 5, min: 1, max: 8 },
	{ start: 5, min: 1, max: 8 },
	{ start: 5, min: 1, max: 8 } // day n
]

determine the max profit over a given day range. You must buy or sell
at the start of the day.

input: array of prices, range of days

output: max profit
